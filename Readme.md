# Asana scrum

An interactive storyboard for Asana. You simply group a set of stories/tasks
in Asana by tagging them with something unique, ex. "sprint-1". Then from
the storyboard, you can search for the tag and populate the storyboard.

## Background

We at [zedge](http://zedge.net/) wanted a more agile way of working with
Asana without having to print out tasks and do all that manual labor. I set
out to solve this and the `asana-scrum` is the result. When it reaches 1.0,
we will have a solution where we use gestures in-air in front of a
projector-screen; Minority report style! I also think the position of
scrumcards will be broadcasted over web-sockets, so that you can collaborate
with of-site team-members.
